- Hi, I’m Willow! I also go by Zero in some online spaces, but at this point I see no reason to so separate my online and IRL interactions.
- I’m interested in learning new languages - both programming and communicative - and in making little tools that can help me, and hopefully other people too.
- I'm currently in university for computer science (there almost certainly will be class repos in here with notes and programs and such. those will be private until my classes have wrapped up)
- I'm looking to collaborate on most of my projects - at least the ones that arent my site, which I am going to attempt to use as a sort of web dev portfolio and would like to develop on my own to better show my skill. Additionally, some of my projects will be hosted on my other profile, @ZerosLab.
- You can reach me by email at zero@32bit.cafe, or on discord at greatresoundingdin.

Remember:
***this too shall pass***
